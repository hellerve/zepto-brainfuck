# zepto-brainfuck

Let's go full circle. This is an implementation of
the Brainfuck programming language in the zepto
programming language.

# Usage

If you have zepto installed, it should be as simple as
typing:

```
zepto bf.zp examples/helloworld.bf
```

This should print "Hello World!" and return `nil`.

This is not a production-ready brainfuck interpreter
(if that exists) and it has not been battle-tested.
It should be somewhat slow.

# Why

I just wanted to test zeptos capabilities once again.

Have fun!
